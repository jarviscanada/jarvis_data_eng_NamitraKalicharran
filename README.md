# Namitra Kalicharran . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Namitra Kalicharran. I am a new graduate from the University of Waterloo where I studied Biology and minored in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for developing novel data infrastructures as demonstrated by my previous experience developing a variety of data pipelines for research labs in Canada and the US during my time in school.

## Skills

**Proficient:** Python, PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, JavaScript, Java, Linux/Bash, RDBMS/SQL, Agile/Scrum, Git

**Competent:** PySpark, Docker, TensorFlow, MongoDB, Scikit-Learn, Flask, FastAPI, NodeJS, ExpressJS, React

**Familiar:** Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Django, Kafka, Vue

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NamitraKalicharran](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NamitraKalicharran)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NamitraKalicharran/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented cluster monitoring program for the Linux Cluster Administration team which was developed in Bash and tested on CentOS 7 virtual machines. All the scripts were automated using crontab and the data was stored in a Docker containerized PostgresQL database which could later be queried for further data analytics.


## Highlighted Projects
**Cowculator** [[Link](https://devpost.com/software/cowculator-g0cwxm)]: Developed a diet tracking progressive web app, using React, MongoDB and FastAPI, that helps users count the carbon footprint of each meal that they have eaten. The progressive web app was deployed on AWS Lamda and won best pitch at ClimateHack!

**Stock Price Prediction** [[Link](https://github.com/NamitraKali/Stock-Price-Prediction)]: Designed and trained a Recurrent Neural Network in Keras to perform Supervised Regression to predict stock prices using technical indicators. Engineered data using Pandas and Numpy to calculate various technical indicators. Created train and testing splits to locally test model performance using scikit-learn.


## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Collaborated in SCRUM teams across many teams at Jarvis. Developed cluster monitoring software for the Linux Cluster Admin team by creating bash scripts that were scheduled in crontab to send data to containerized Postgres database. Leading a SCRUM team of 3 other data engineers to work on JDBC connection and a custom grep app to be integrated into a trading platform.

**Data Science Intern, Harvard University (2019)**: Implemented data pipeline in Spark for processing drug data. Workflow scheduling was managed using Luigi and the pipeline was tested against a subset of the dataset on a SLURM cluster. The pipeline was deployed on Harvard's HPC SLURM cluster. Pipeline resulted in 10x efficiency boost in processing.
