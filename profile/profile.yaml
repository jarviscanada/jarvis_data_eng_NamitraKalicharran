# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # Please read the project description guideline carefully. Make sure you follow the simplified SDLC pattern. (t.ly/NlXQ)
    # Please include the following keywords: CentOS, Bash/Shell, docker, RDBMS/SQL/Postgresql, crontab, data analytics
    description: "Implemented cluster monitoring program for the Linux Cluster Administration team which was developed in Bash and tested on CentOS 7 virtual machines. All the scripts were automated using crontab and the data was stored in a Docker containerized PostgresQL database which could later be queried for further data analytics."

  - name: "Core Java Projects"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "JDBC App: Designed a Java Grep App made to replicate the Linux grep command, searching files in a directory and matching strings to within the files. There are two different implementations, one using BufferedReader one using Java's Stream API. This project incorporates Maven, Streams, Regex and Lambda Functions and is unit tested using JUnit. Lastly, the application containerized using Docker."
      - "Grep App: Developed a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application that connects to a Docker containerized PostgreSQL database. This application allows users to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) onto a database. Implemented using Java, PostgreSQL, Docker and Maven."

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Collaborated in SCRUM teams across many teams at Jarvis. Developed cluster monitoring software for the Linux Cluster Admin team by creating bash scripts that were scheduled in crontab to send data to containerized Postgres database. Leading a SCRUM team of 3 other data engineers to work on JDBC connection and a custom grep app to be integrated into a trading platform."
  
  - title: "Data Science Intern"
    company: "Harvard University"
    duration: "2019"
    description: "Implemented data pipeline in Spark for processing drug data. Workflow scheduling was managed using Luigi and the pipeline was tested against a subset of the dataset on a SLURM cluster. The pipeline was deployed on Harvard's HPC SLURM cluster. Pipeline resulted in 10x efficiency boost in processing."
