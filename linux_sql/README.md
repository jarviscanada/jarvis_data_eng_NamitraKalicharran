# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent

# Introduction
This is a monitoring tool for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team. This tool will be able to store and track the hardware specifications of each node as well as monitor their resources. The tech powering this tool is bash scripts which will access a postgres database, while the entire project will be containerized using Docker.

# Quick start
- Start a psql instance using `psql_docker.sh create`
- Create tables using `ddl.sql`
- Grab hardware specs using `host_info.sh`
- Grab node resources using `host_usage.sh`
- Crontab setup
